## What is a Technology Radar?

A technology radar is a framework for tracking and managing technologies that are relevant to your business. It allows you to monitor and assess technologies throughout their lifecycle, from initial hype to widespread adoption and, eventually, obsolescence. By using a technology radar, you gain a clear picture of which technologies to explore, experiment with, fully integrate, or gradually phase out.

## Why Use a Technology Radar?

A technology radar helps organisations:

- Identify emerging technologies that could provide a competitive edge.
- Evaluate which technologies to test before full-scale implementation.
- Adopt proven technologies that align with business goals.
- Phase out outdated technologies that no longer add value.

## How a Technology Radar Works

A well-structured technology radar categorizes technologies based on their lifecycle and relevance to your company. It typically follows these stages:

1. Assess – Identify and monitor new technologies that show promise.
2. Try – Experiment with technologies to determine their feasibility.
3. Adopt – Implement technologies that prove valuable and effective.
4. Hold/Reduce – Phase out technologies that are becoming obsolete or no longer serve your business needs.
